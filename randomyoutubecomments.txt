i played starbound years before I even knew about terraria and I will die on this hill, starbound is amazing and it's such a tragedy that they abandoned it. all the outfits you can find, the instruments, I just love it.
I have been playing Starbound off and on for 15 years, I am not kidding. It's a fantastic game, but it is rather short and not particular difficult if you know what you're doing. I would wholeheartedly recommend you continue, just remember to play it for the experience rather than for the plot alone. Starbound is more of a work of art than a story.
If you're gonna continue, here are some tips:
You can break walls inside caves near the surface, by holding right click. It's good for preserving torches.
You should gather a lot of copper, silver and gold (it's deeper underground) from the start, there's a dude in the Outpost that has challenge rooms and by completing them, you will unlock dash, double jump and sphere ability.
In the Outpost there is a teleporter shop, which has a teleporter. Click e on it to save a bookmark, you'll be able to teleport to the outpost from the ship.
